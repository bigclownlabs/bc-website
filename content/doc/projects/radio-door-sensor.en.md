## Download BigClown Playground

Download the latest [BigClown Playground](https://github.com/bigclownlabs/bch-playground/releases) for your operating system.

After download run the Playground application.

{{% img-zoom src="playground-run.jpg" width="100%" %}}

Now we need to make sure that modules use the latest firmware. You need to flash your **{{% shop "Radio Dongle" %}}** and the remote node **{{% shop "Core Module" %}}**.


## Flash Door Sensor firmware

1. Connect **just** the {{% shop "Door Sensor" %}} to the USB of your computer.

2. In Playground go to **Firmware tab**, select the firmware `bigclownlabs/bcf-radio-door-sensor`, choose the device's serial port in **Device** and click **FLASH FIRMWARE**.

    {{% img-zoom src="playground-flash-door-sensor.jpg" width="100%" %}}

3. Disconnect **Door Sensor** from your computer. Disconnect the batteries and keep the Door Sensor unpowered for pairing process later.



## Flash Radio Dongle firmware

1. Connect **just** the {{% shop "Radio Dongle" %}} to the USB of your computer.

2. In Playground go to **Firmware tab**, select the firmware `bigclownlabs/bcf-gateway-usb-dongle`, choose the device's serial port in **Device** and click **FLASH FIRMWARE**.

    {{% img-zoom src="playground-flash-dongle.jpg" width="100%" %}}

3. Keep **{{% shop "Radio Dongle" %}}** connected to your computer

## Start the gateway

3. Stop the pairing by clicking **Pairing stop**.

    {{% img-zoom src="playground-pairing-stop.jpg" width="100%" %}}

## Test the Door Sensor

1. Switch to **MQTT** tab and subscribe to `#` topic.

2. Now put the magnet to and away from the sensor, you should see MQTT messages in the top window.

3. Other messages are button press and temperature change. Try it!

    {{% img-zoom src="playground-mqtt-test.jpg" width="100%" %}}

{{% note "success" %}}Perfect! You have created radio network which is receiving events and measured temperature.{{% /note %}}

## IFTTT integration

In this section, we will create an **Applet** in the **IFTTT** service. The **Applet** is a sort of event-trigger mechanism.

1. Open the web-browser and go to [**IFTTT**](https://ifttt.com):

    {{% img-zoom src="ifttt-01.png" width="50%" %}}

2. Log in to IFTTT service. You can sign up using your Google or Facebook identity:

    {{% img-zoom src="ifttt-07.svg" width="50%"  %}}

8. Click on **+that** in the `if this then that` sentence:

    {{% img-zoom src="ifttt-08.png" width="50%"  %}}

9. Find action service with the name **Notifications** and select it:

    {{% img-zoom src="ifttt-09.png" width="50%"  %}}

10. Click on **Send a notification from the IFTTT app**:

    {{% img-zoom src="ifttt-10.png" width="50%"  %}}

11. Edit the **Notification** field and insert the text `Door Sensor Alarm at {{OccurredAt}} !` and push the **Create action** button:

    {{% img-zoom src="ifttt-11.png" width="50%"  %}}

12. Click on the **Finish** button:

    {{% img-zoom src="ifttt-12.png" width="50%"  %}}

13. Click on the **Webhooks** button:

    {{% img-zoom src="ifttt-13.png" width="50%"  %}}

14. Click on the **Documentation** button:

    {{% img-zoom src="ifttt-14.png" width="50%"  %}}

15. Now you have your notification key. **Keep this page open so you can copy this key to the Node-RED later.**

    {{% img-zoom src="ifttt-15.png" width="50%"  %}}

16. Install the **IFTTT** app on your smart phone and sign in using the same account as you just used to create the applet. Allow the app to use the push notifications when asked.

{{% note "success" %}}At this point, you've got working notification **Applet** in the **IFTTT** service.{{% /note %}}

## Node-RED plug-in for IFTTT

To use IFTTT in Node-RED, we can use simple plug-in which will send notifications.

1. Click on **MQTT** tab, then on the menu in the top right corner and select **Manage palette**

    {{% img-zoom src="node-red-manage-palette.jpg" width="100%" %}}

2. Switch to **Install** tab, search for `ifttt` and click on the **install** button. In the pop-up window, click again on **Install**.

    {{% img-zoom src="node-red-install-ifttt.jpg" width="100%" %}}

3. After installation you see confirmation that new nodes has beed addded to the Node-RED.

    {{% img-zoom src="node-red-installed-confirmation.jpg" width="50%" %}}

{{% note "success" %}}Perfect! Node-RED plugin for IFTTT will allow to send notification directly to you phone.{{% /note %}}

## Import Node-RED notification flow

    ```

2. Click on the top right **menu**, then select **Import** and **Clipboard**.

    {{% img-zoom src="node-red-menu-import.jpg" width="100%" %}}

3. Paste the text from clipboard to the textbox and press **Import**.

    {{% img-zoom src="node-red-dialog-import.jpg" width="100%" %}}

## Set IFTTT key

1. You have imported the flow. Now you need to fill in your own **IFTTT key**. Double click on the **IFTTT** node.

    {{% img-zoom src="node-red-doubleclick-ifttt.jpg" width="100%" %}}

2. Click on a **pencil symbol** and copy and **paste the key** from the last step of IFTTT integration chapter. Check that the **Event name** is set to the **door** event. Then click **Done**.

    {{% img-zoom src="node-red-config-ifttt.jpg" width="100%" %}}

## Run and test your flow!

1. Everytime you change the flow, you have to click on the **Deploy** button in the right top corner. **Please do that now.**

    {{% img-zoom src="node-red-deploy.jpg" width="100%" %}}

2. Now put the magnet near the magnetic sensor and away on your Radio Door Sensor. You should get IFTTT notification in a few seconds later!

    You should see "true" and "false" messages in the right **debug** tab and during **false** there will be a **Sent!** green flag near the IFTTT node for a while.

    {{% img-zoom src="node-red-test.jpg" width="100%" %}}

    If you would like be notified on "true" messages instead of **false**, just open the **switch node** and change the `false` text in the rules to `true`.

    {{% img-zoom src="phone-notification.jpg" width="100%" %}}

{{% note "success" %}}Now find the right spot for the **Radio Door Sensor** and enjoy the notifications you get!{{% /note %}}

## More functionality

Import this flow to Node-RED that will be able to:

- Show current door state with a graphical padlock
- Display the stopwatch for opened doors. Also get an event after the doors are opened for set amount of seconds
- Check the state of the door at the set time and generate event
