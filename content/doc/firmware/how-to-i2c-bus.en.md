This is the main bus BigClown uses to communicate with the most of the sensors and modules. All sensors and modules have their own addres in the [**BigClown I²C address space**]({{< relref "/doc/hardware/i2c-address-space.en.md" >}}).

Normally you don't need to use I²C API, because all the sensors have their own libraries that gives you the measured data. You will need I²C APIs in case you implement your own I²C sensor or chip.


{{< note "info" "As always..." >}}
... all available SDK functions for I²C can be found in the [SDK documentation](http://sdk.bigclown.com/group__bc__i2c.html).{{< /note >}}

## I²C buses on the Core Module

There are two busses on the **{{< shop "Core Module" >}}**. They are called:

* `BC_I2C_I2C0` - Using `SDA0` and `SCL0` (17, 18) pins in the bottom right corner of the **{{< shop "Core Module" >}}**
* `BC_I2C_I2C1` - Using `SDA1` and `SCL1` (27, 28) pins in the top right corner of the **{{< shop "Core Module" >}}**

If you use **{{< shop "Tag Module" >}}** then the right three tag connectors use `BC_I2C_I2C0` and left three are using `BC_I2C_I2C1`. You can se this [**in the schematics**] (https://github.com/bigclownlabs/bc-hardware/tree/master/out/bc-module-tag).

{{< note "info">}}
There's even a another **virtual** I2C bus ` BC_I2C_I2C_1W` which is encapsulated in 1-Wire protocol and can be used with **{{< shop "Sensor Module" >}}** and **{{< shop "1-Wire Module" >}}** to extend the communication distance.

## Init I²C

By default the I²C buses **are not initialized** to save the power. Hovewer when you initialize at least one sensor in the SDK, the bus is initialized with the first sensor in their respective `bc_xxx_init` function.
If you use only your sensor in the project, you have to initialize the I²C bus.

```
bc_i2c_init(BC_I2C_I2C0, BC_I2C_SPEED_400_KHZ);
```

## Reading and writing 8 or 16 bits

You can use functions to write or read 1 byte, 2 bytes or specific number of bytes which is explained in next chapter below.

```
bool bc_i2c_memory_write_8b (bc_i2c_channel_t channel, uint8_t device_address, uint32_t memory_address, uint8_t data)
bool bc_i2c_memory_write_16b (bc_i2c_channel_t channel, uint8_t device_address, uint32_t memory_address, uint16_t data)

bool bc_i2c_memory_read_8b (bc_i2c_channel_t channel, uint8_t device_address, uint32_t memory_address, uint8_t *data)
bool bc_i2c_memory_read_16b (bc_i2c_channel_t channel, uint8_t device_address, uint32_t memory_address, uint16_t *data)
```

For example to write the data

```
bc_i2c_memory_write_8b(BC_I2C_I2C0, 0x48, 0x01, 0x81);
bc_i2c_memory_write_16b(BC_I2C_I2C0, 0x48, 0x01, 0x0180);
```

To read the data

```
uint8_t reg_configuration;
bc_i2c_memory_read_8b(BC_I2C_I2C0, 0x48, 0x01, &reg_configuration);
```

## Reading and writing more data


```
bool bc_i2c_write (bc_i2c_channel_t channel, const bc_i2c_transfer_t *transfer)
bool bc_i2c_read (bc_i2c_channel_t channel, const bc_i2c_transfer_t *transfer)
```

Example to read more data:

```
bc_i2c_memory_transfer_t transfer;
uint8_t rx_buffer[6];

transfer.device_address = 0x48;
transfer.memory_address = 0x28;
transfer.buffer = rx_buffer;
transfer.length = sizeof(rx_buffer);

bc_i2c_memory_read(BC_I2C_I2C0, &transfer);
```
