**Anemone** is the ecosystem of cloud, web and mobile app, hardware devices, 3D-printed enclosures, documentation, support, etc.

It helps the so-called *fintechs* (startups from the financial sector) to come up with the new ideas and leverage modern IoT and cloud technologies in the world of finances. Technically speaking, it is about **flows** and **tentacles**. **Flows** make it possible to create visual bonds between triggers and actions, while **tentacles** are a hardware IoT devices you can hook into the flows. And **Anemone** can do it neatly and simply.

You have two options to interact with your flows - either in your web browser in the mobile app (available for both iOS an Android).
