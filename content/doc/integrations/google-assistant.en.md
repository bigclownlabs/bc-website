With the Google Assistant integration you can control you BigClown kits with your Google Assistant.

For now, you can control [Power Controller](https://shop.bigclown.com/power-controller-kit/), [CO2 Monitor](https://shop.bigclown.com/co2-monitor-kit/), [Push Button](https://shop.bigclown.com/push-button-kit/) and [Motion Detektor](https://shop.bigclown.com/motion-detector-kit/).

{{< note "info" "What is Google Assistant?"  >}}

Google Assistant is virtual assistant, made by Google. Avaliable on bilions of devices, you can use it to do many things. Now, even control your BigClown kits. :)

## Setup

Setup will be containing two steps:

1. Setup of the kit and Blynk mobile app
2. Adding Node-RED nodes to enable Google Assistant support

### Kit and Blynk setup
Please setup at least one of supported modules using [Projects guides](https://www.bigclown.com/doc/projects/push-the-button/) and make sure you have [Blynk](https://www.bigclown.com/doc/projects/push-the-button/#blynk-mobile-app-set-up) installed on your device. Google Assistant will use Blynk to communicate with your Hub in the background and fulfill your commands.

### Node-RED setup
{{% note "danger" %}}If you are using the new **BigClown Playground**, then use the **Functions** tab instead of using **http://localhost:1880/**. Also the pairing process is now done in **Devices** tab. For communication test use the **Messages** tab.{{% /note %}}

1. Open **Node-RED** in your web browser:

    **http://localhost:1880/**

2. You can use either existing workspace or create new one.

3. Insert the following snippet in the flow (using **Menu >>Â Import >> Clipboard**) and click in **Flow 1** tab to paste the code

    ```

    It will look like this:

    {{% img-zoom src="node-red-config-needed.PNG" %}}

    {{% note "info" %}}This snippet prepares Node-RED to fulfill commands from Google Assistant{{% /note %}}
4. Configure each Blynk node with Blynk config. 
   {{% img-zoom src="node-red-pick-config.PNG" %}}

5. (Optional) Connect *data nodes* to **Save Data (connect data nodes here)** to access sensor values (temperature, humidity ...) from your modules.
    {{% img-zoom src="node-red-data-nodes.PNG" %}}

6. Deploy the flow using the **Deploy** button in the top-right corner.
7. After that, all Blynk nodes should have green indicator at the bottom and say connected. Your setup should look like this:

### Google Assistant setup
To complete Google Assistant setup, **you need a mobile device**. 

1. Launch BigClown action by saying (or typing) *Talk to BigClown*</br>
    {{% img-zoom src="ga-talk-to-bigclown.jpg" width="40%" height="40%" %}}
2. Confirm that you want to start the setup by saying *yes*</br>
{{% img-zoom src="ga-setup-key.jpg" width="40%" height="40%" %}}
3. If you had already completed the Node-RED setup above, you don't need to open the link, otherwise, complete the Node-RED setup first and come back when you are finished. 
Reply with **just the Blynk secret key** you used to configure Blynk nodes in Node-RED.</br>
{{% img-zoom src="ga-instructions.jpg" width="40%" height="40%" %}}
4. Confirm that you want to use this key</br>
{{% img-zoom src="ga-confirmation.jpg" width="40%" height="40%" %}}
5. If everything worked well, your modules will show up now. Pick the module to send commands to it.</br>
{{% img-zoom src="ga-welcome.jpg" width="40%" height="40%" %}}</br>
6. Try it out! You can now use voice enabled devices like Google Home to control your BigClown modules just like you would with your phone. 
Say **Talk to BigClown** to start the Action again.</br>
