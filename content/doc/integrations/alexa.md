In the end of Alexa integration you will be able to control your BigClown projects using Alexa. Result of this article will be controlling [LED strip](https://shop.bigclown.com/led-strip-rgbw-1m-144-leds/).

You need to install plugin to Node-RED (functions). Open BigClown Playground on you computer. If you want use for this integration your computer, just open functions in menu. However if you want to use [BigClown Hub](https://shop.bigclown.com/bigclown-hub/), you have to see on main page available hubs like on following screenshot just click on one and it will open in your browser.

Open [Alexa app](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201602060) on your smartphone or use browser on your computer on [desktop app](https://alexa.amazon.com/). Navigate to Skills and install [Node-RED skill](https://skills-store.amazon.com/deeplink/dp/B01N0D97FZ?deviceType=app&share&refSuffix=ss_copy).

## Hardware
As I said in the beggining. We will be controling BigClown LED strip. Prepair MicroUSB cable, [Core Module](https://shop.bigclown.com/core-module/) and [Power Module](https://shop.bigclown.com/power-module/) with DC source. Now connect Core Module to the computer via MicroUSB cable and open BigClown Playground on your computer. In Playground navigate to the Firmware section and you should be able to see connected device. Choose bigclownlabs/bcf-radio-powe-controller and version depends on your LED strip you bought. I bought rgbw144 and click Flash firmware.

Connected with your node to functions you imported and deploy. You have to wait 5 seconds until alexa plugin connects to servers and than say "Alexa, turn [your device] to red". That's it!
