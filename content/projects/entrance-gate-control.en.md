Basic wireless door remotes are unreliable and have short range. With Power Controller Kit you can control your entrance gate securely over the internet. See the gate state and open doors from the other side of the world for your visitors or parcel guy.

### Overview

Raspberry Pi is connected over Blynk to your phone and on the other side over Radio Dongle to your entry gate. You can control it with the relay. You can extend this kit with a Sensor Module and get a feedback when the gate is opened or closed. This way you can be notified that for example gate is opened for a long time in teh night.
