You can use LED strips t create 7-segment or even bigger displays. The Power Controller can control hundreds of color LEDs.

### Overview

Each digit has it own Power Controller Kit. The advantage is that each digit can be in different rooms without needing any cables, data are send wirelessly. Your Raspberry Pi controls all the segments and display date, time, temperature, humidity and other values from BigClown sensors.
