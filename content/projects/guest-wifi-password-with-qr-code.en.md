Now you can generate temporary passwords for your guest. They even do not need to type long password over and over again. Just scan the code and connect.

### Overview

The content of the code is generated on your router, Raspberry Pi, Turris Omnia. You can use the buttons on the LCD Module to generate new password QR code.
