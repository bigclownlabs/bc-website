When all the systems fail, you need independent and reliable system to call for a help. The LoRa technology is ideal for this factory use-case. Installing a wiring is not an option, it takes weeks and and working force is expensive. Skoda Auto is using it's own LoRa factory network where all the notifications are send.

### Overview

Press the button and the surveillance center gets an notification and sends a serviceman to your place.
