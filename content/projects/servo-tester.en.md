You can connect regular servo motor instead of smart digital LED strip to the Power Module. More motors can be connected to other PWM GPIO pins on the Core Module. You can control up to 9 servo motors thanks to hardware PWM. Please see [pin description](/doc/hardware/header-pinout/).

### What you need

* {{< shop "Core Module" >}}
* {{< shop "Power Module" >}}
* Any servo motor
