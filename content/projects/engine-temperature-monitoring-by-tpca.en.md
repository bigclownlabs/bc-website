With long-term monitoring of temperature, vibration and other variables you can predict the service of the machine. This can save money because of unplanned downtimes of your machines. Connect any digital or analog sensor (DS18B20, PT100, PT1000). Measured values are sned wirelessly for further processing.

### Overview

Gathered data from sensors are processed on your server or Raspberry Pi. You can graph the measured values and send alarms in case something goes out of its limits.
