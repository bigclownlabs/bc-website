Get a notification in a moment, when the postman opens your mailbox and puts a letter inside. You can also use the second mechanical switch to detect when you open the side-doors to clear the state that the mailbox is full.

### What you need

* {{< shop "Core Module" >}}
* {{< shop "Mini Battery Module" >}}
* {{< shop "Sensor Module" >}}
* Magnetic or mechanical swithc NO or NC (normally opened/closed)

### Firmware

You can use already prepared firmware `bcf-radio-door-sensor`.
