### Used tools and processed data

Google Analytics Google LLC, located at 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States. Google Analytics uses the following personal data to process traffic statistics:

* IP address to determine approximate user location. We anonymize the IP address before accepting Google's servers by replacing the last part of the IP address with zero. Due to the geographical location, we can better analyze the cities, regions and countries from which users of our site come from. These data are only available in aggregate in Google Analytics and can not be found with one particular visitor.
* The so-called cookie with cid identifier. This identifier is used to determine if a visitor is on the web for the first time. It also makes it easier for us to allocate new traffic to different resources and better distribution of advertising budgets.
* We collect information about where you came from on our site, what site you visited, what you did on it, and what time spent on the site. We also collect data about the technologies you are using: we estimate the type of device, the operating system, the version of the web browser. Thanks to this, we can improve the site so you can use it better on all devices. This data is difficult to connect with individuals and we do not aim to identify a particular physical person - we know only that someone from one browser visited the site and that page.
