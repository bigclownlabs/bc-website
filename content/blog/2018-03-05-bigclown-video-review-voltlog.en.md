We have sent BigClown demo suitcase to Florin who does nice electronics videos on his YouTube channel [VolLog](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdXHgsCiql_78oT5ydXWvzA).
Florin created this video series where he does unboxing and creates his first wireless IoT project in less than 30 minutes.

Florin put two wireless {{<shop "Climate Monitor Kit">}}s in different rooms in his home. He's measuring temperatures and storing them on his Raspberry Pi which is running [Grafana & InfluxDB](https://developers.bigclown.com/integrations/grafana-for-visualization).

In the video he appreciated the simplicity and good documentation which helped him to start really fast.
