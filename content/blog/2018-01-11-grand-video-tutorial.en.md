Hey guys,

our friend **Martin Hubáček** has created a wonderful **video tutorial** that will help you to get started with the **BigClown IoT Kit**. You will get a grasp how to control relay, smart LED strip and work with **Node-RED** flow-based programming. I hope you will enjoy watching it as much as I did.

You will find the **YouTube video** below or start watching it here right away:

Cool, right? :-) **Thanks, Martin!** We realize that starting with the IoT might be challenging, but the feeling when you achieve something is totally rewarding and elevates your skillset to the next level. Our mission is to make this process enjoyable and as much smooth as possible. That's why we will pay much higher attention to the video content this year and keep delivering superb technical support to all our customers.

Don't afraid to ask any question if in doubts or if you get stuck at any point - **we are here for you!**

Cheers! Pavel
