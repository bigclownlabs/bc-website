  Family dinners are a great recipe for family well-being. You can stop for a
  while together, discuss what's new, and talk about what awaits you. I was
  wondering how to make these moments a little bit wiser.

My recipe is simple:

## "1 wisdom a week"

**Every week on Friday,** I will send you an e-mail with one processed wisdom, easy to explain, catching yours and your children attention.

**There is nothing to wait for. Sign up, and I will send you the first tip on Friday:**

<script charset="utf-8" type="text/javascript" src="//js.hsforms.net/forms/shell.js"></script>

<script>
  hbspt.forms.create({
	portalId: "5560121",
	formId: "d8f631bb-0a2c-475d-b4a8-c0d7689570c2"
});
</script>
