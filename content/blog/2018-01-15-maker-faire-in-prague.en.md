Hi guys,

we are thrilled to experience the first **Maker Faire** event in Prague in the history. This exhibition has a decent tradition in the world of makers globally. It will take place on **April 14-15, 2018** (weekend). As passionate supporters of the trending **maker movement**, it is our honor to be a part of this faire, and we are eager to contribute to make it great.

These are the roles we are going to take our part in:

* We will organize the so-called **Clownference** - a series of practical workshops about hardware design, firmware development and building great projects with the **BigClown IoT Kit**.

* Networking is a part of our DNA. That's why we are approaching some of the **greatest influencers** to make this event epic.

* There will be a contest where you can win some **great prizes** like a clown suitcase fully packed with colorful hardware!

* We will do the on-site **printing of our enclosures** on 3D printers from Prusa (i3 MK3). We will be printing them for you for free!

* There will be a live demonstration of two **BigClown integrations**:

    * Secure router **Turris Omnia** (CZ.NIC)

    * Cloud platform **Anemone** (Juicymo)

Don't forget to **sign up your project** and exhibit and share it with other people for free. It does not matter whether it is built on Raspberry Pi, Arduino or BigClown... just **show what you achieved**.

We appreciate a generous donation from **Prusa Research** which makes this amazing event possible.

So, put a **bold mark** on your calendar and spend a weekend with DIY and open-source enthusiasts and don't miss a chance to visit this extraordinary event and become a part of the ever-growing community. We all know that the "first-time-whatever" events are the most memorable ones.

Thanks for your support and we are looking forward to meeting you there! Pavel
