This kit is our most popular smart gadget. It allows you to monitor several important values in your surroundings - temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure and light intensity. Based on measured data you can control thermal comfort - a state of mind that expresses satisfaction with the temperature climate and which is based on subjective evaluation.
