You can use the **Climate Module** altogether with the **Mini Battery Module** and the **Core Module** to create a very compact wireless environmental sensor.

## Features

**Temperature sensor TMP112 (TI)**

* Measurement accuracy (typical):
    * ± 0.1 °C at 25 °C
    * ± 0.25 °C in the range 0 °C to 65 °C
    * ± 0.5 °C in the range -40 °C to 125 °C
* 12-bit resolution (0.0625 °C)
