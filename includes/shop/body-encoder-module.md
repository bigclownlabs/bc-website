The rotarty encoder has 12 positions per revolution. The rotation range is not limited such as with a potentiometer and can be rotated in either direction at any number of revolutions.

The module was designed primarily to complement the **LCD Module**. A typical application is a wireless thermostat. The rotary encoder could be used as a convenient navigation control in the graphical menu.

This module also features three 5-pin sockets allowing you to connect BigClown tags.

**Important: The illustrated aluminum knob is not a part of the module and is sold as an optional accessory separately.**
