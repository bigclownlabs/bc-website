This module can power a BigClown node thanks to its integrated LDO regulator. The LDO generates 3.3 V output from the 5 V input.

Reliability is important - that's why we have implemented a **smart** overvoltage, undervoltage and reverse polarity **protection** on the power jack input. This feature guarantees the input voltage range to always stay within the proper limits.

There are also two 5-pin sockets available. These make it possible to connect BigClown tags.
