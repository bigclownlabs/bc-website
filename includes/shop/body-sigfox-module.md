**Signed agreement with your Sigfox network operator is a must.**

Thanks to narrow band transmission, the device can communicate with the operator cell over a distance of more than 100 km.

This network has a wide range of applications. Its use is particularly useful in energy consumption meters (e.g. water meters, gas meters, etc.), environmental sensors (e.g. a CO₂ sensor), but also in applications for early reports of accidents or defects (e.g. water leak detector).

However, there are some limitations on the transmitted data. In the Sigfox network, only **140 messages a day** with the maximum data **payload of 12 bytes** (96 bits) can be transferred from a device.

The Sigfox network is data-agnostic. That means it is up to you to define the structure of the data. On a Sigfox backend, you can specify the so-called callback, the service that will be called when data arrive from a device. For example, you can define a webhook to your server - the HTTP POST call with JSON body.
