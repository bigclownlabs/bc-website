Some BigClown modules already have one or more extra 5-pin sockets allowing you to connect a BigClown tag. But sometimes the number of positions is not enough, the socket is not available, or you need to extend the I²C bus with an additional channel. And that's when the **Tag Module** can help.

## Features

* 6x 5-pin socket position for BigClown tag
* 3x tag positions are connected to I2C0 (right side)
* 3x tag positions are connected to I2C1 (left side)
* Integrated pull-up resistors on SDA/SCL signals of I2C1 bus
* Operating temperature range: -20 to 70 °C
* Mechanical dimensions: 44 x 55 mm
