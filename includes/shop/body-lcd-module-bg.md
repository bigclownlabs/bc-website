You can control your application using the **two buttons** located below the LCD screen. The module is also equipped with a **gesture sensor** (Avago APDS-9960). This circuit, composed of the infrared transmitter and four directional photodiodes responding to different wavelengths, can also be used to measure the light intensity and color or as a proximity sensor.

The **LCD Module** also includes six RGB LEDs that can be used to indicate status or as a light alarm.

A typical use-case for the **LCD Module** is a wireless thermostat, or it can directly display values from various sensors located both indoors and outdoors.

The **LCD Module** can also function as a unique status display for the Turris Omnia router.
