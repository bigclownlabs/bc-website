Carbon dioxide (or CO₂) is a colorless and odorless gas that is vital to life on Earth. Its nominal concentration is about 400 ppm (0.04 %). There are many occurrences of CO₂ in nature. For example humans produce CO₂ when exhaling.

**The high concentration of CO₂ leads to acidity and various health related problems.**

We have equipped the LP8 sensor with additional circuitry for efficient power management and I²C-only interfacing. This module also features three 5-pin sockets allowing you to connect BigClown tags.

## Features

* Carbon dioxide (CO₂) sensor LP8 (SenseAir)
* Non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) technology
* Measurement range of CO₂: 0 to 10 000 ppm
* Measurement accuracy: ±50 ppm CO₂ ±3 % of reading (Note 1)
* I²C-only interface (integrated UART bridge and I/O expander)
* Constant current source for 470 mF supercap
* Long battery life time
* 3 sockets for a BigClown tag
* Low power consumption:
    * 6 µA (6 measurements per hour)
    * 61 µA (1 measurement per minute)
* Operating voltage range: 3 V to 3.6 V
* Operating temperature range: 0 to 50 °C
* Mechanical dimensions: 88 x 55 mm

Note 1: Accuracy ±50 ppm is achieved after 24 days of operation and auto calibration process.
